if you can dream and not make dreams your master
if you can think and not make thoughts your aim
if you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
and treat those two impostors just the same
if you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools
or watch the things you gave your life to broken
and stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools
